UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE
Approximately 2 in 5 survey respondents say they either “sometimes,” “rarely,” or “never” install software
updates (NCA). One of the easiest ways to protect accounts and information is to keep software and
applications updated. Updates are periodically released to fix software problems and provide security
patches for known vulnerabilities. This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, don’t hit the “remind me later”
button. Take action to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals.
OUR TIPS AND ADVICE
Keeping software up to date is an easy way improve your digital security. For added convenience,
turn on the automatic updates in your device or application security settings! Set it and forget it!
KEEP SOFTWARE UP TO DATE WITH THESE STEPS:
1. Check for notifications
Devices and applications will usually notify you when the latest software updates become available,
but it’s important to check periodically as well. Software updates include devices’ operating systems,
programs and apps. It’s important to install ALL updates, especially for web browsers and antivirus
software, or apps with financial or sensitive information.
2. Install updates as soon as possible
When a software update becomes available, especially critical updates, be sure to install them as
soon as possible. Attackers won’t wait, and you shouldn’t either!
3. Turn on automatic updates
With automatic updates, devices will install updates as soon as they become available—Easy! To
turn on the automatic updates feature, look in the device settings, usually under Software or
Security.
