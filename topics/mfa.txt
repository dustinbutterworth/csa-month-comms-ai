TURN ON MULTIFACTOR
AUTHENTICATION
In a recent National Cybersecurity Alliance survey, 57% of respondents said they have heard of
multifactor authentication (MFA), but many people don’t realize that multifactor authentication is an
incredibly important layer of protection in keeping accounts secure. This month, we’re showing others
how easy it is to turn on MFA whenever possible.
OUR TIPS AND ADVICE
MFA provides extra security by providing a secondary method confirming your identity when logging
into accounts. MFA usually requires you to enter a code sent to your phone or email, or one generated
by an authenticator app. Push notifications are also common methods of MFA. This added step
prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to your accounts, even if your password has been
compromised.
Open your app or account settings
It may be called Account Settings, Settings & Privacy or similar.
Turn on multifactor authentication
It may also be called two-factor authentication, two-step authentication or similar.
Confirm
Select an MFA method to use from the options provided. Examples are:
Receiving a code by text or email
Using an authenticator app: These phone-based apps generate a new code every 30
seconds or so.
Biometrics: This uses facial recognition or fingerprints to confirm your identity.
